# Comprehensive Metagenomic Analysis Workflow for Nanopore Sequencing Data

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow for metagenomic analysis with Nanopore sequencing data. The steps include quality control, taxonomic abundance estimation with Kraken and Bracken, and Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) analysis.

## Step 1: Quality Control with NanoPlot

1.1. Install NanoPlot (for Nanopore data quality assessment):

   You can install NanoPlot using Conda or pip.

   Using Conda:
   ```bash
   conda install -c bioconda nanoplot
1.2. Run NanoPlot to assess the quality of your Nanopore data:
NanoPlot -o quality_assessment -t "Nanopore Data Quality" your_nanopore_data.fastq

This generates detailed quality assessment plots and statistics for your Nanopore data.
1.3. Review the NanoPlot HTML report to assess the quality of your Nanopore reads and identify potential issues.


#Host Read Removal with Bowtie2
Install Bowtie2:
If you haven't already installed Bowtie2, you can typically install it using a package manager like conda:
conda install -c bioconda bowtie2

#Create a Bowtie2 Index:
Before using Bowtie2 for host read removal, you need to create a Bowtie2 index of the host genome or sequences you want to remove.
bowtie2-build host_genome.fasta host_index

#Replace host_genome.fasta with the file containing your host genome sequences and host_index with the desired index name.
Host Read Removal:

Use Bowtie2 to align your Nanopore reads against the host genome index and output unaligned reads (i.e., reads that didn't align to the host genome).
bowtie2 -x host_index -U your_nanopore_reads.fastq -S host_aligned.sam --un host_unaligned.fastq




Step 2: Preprocessing and Classification with Kraken
2.1. Install Kraken and download a Kraken database suitable for your analysis.

2.2. Preprocess your Nanopore data:
# Quality trimming and adapter removal using Porechop
porechop -i your_nanopore_data.fastq -o preprocessed_data.fastq

2.3. Further filter out low-quality reads and artifacts using Filtlong:
# Install Filtlong (if not already installed)
# Download and compile Filtlong
git clone https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong.git
cd Filtlong
make

# Perform length and quality filtering
filtlong --min_length 1000 --min_mean_q 7 --min_passes 1 --target_bases 1000000000 preprocessed_data.fastq > high_quality_data.fastq

2.4. Run Kraken for taxonomic classification:
kraken2 --db $KRAKEN2_DB_PATH --threads 4 --output kraken_output.txt high_quality_data.fastq

Step 3: Abundance Estimation with Bracken
3.1. Install Bracken and create a Bracken database from your Kraken database.
bracken-build -k 35 -d $KRAKEN2_DB_PATH -l 150 -t 4 -x bracken_db

3.2. Estimate abundance using Bracken:
bracken -d bracken_db -i kraken_output.txt -o bracken_abundance.txt

3.3. Alpha Diversity Analysis
Alpha diversity measures the diversity within a single sample, providing insights into species richness and evenness. The Shannon diversity index is a common metric.

Extract Abundance Information

First, you need to extract the abundance information from the Bracken output. You can use a script or manually extract the relevant data.

Calculate Alpha Diversity

You can use R or Python for this analysis. In R, you can use the "vegan" package for diversity analysis:
# Load necessary libraries
library(vegan)

# Read your abundance data
abundance_data <- read.table("bracken_abundance.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Calculate Shannon diversity
shannon_diversity <- diversity(abundance_data, index = "shannon")

# Print the result
print(shannon_diversity)
Visualization
You can create diversity plots, such as bar plots or rarefaction curves, to visualize the alpha diversity. Use ggplot2 or other plotting libraries to create informative visualizations.

3.4. Beta Diversity Analysis
Beta diversity assesses the differences in species composition between different samples. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index is a commonly used metric.

Prepare Abundance Data

Organize your abundance data in a way that makes it suitable for beta diversity analysis. You may need to transpose the data or create a data matrix.

Calculate Beta Diversity

In R, you can use the "vegan" package for beta diversity calculations. Here's an example:
# Load necessary libraries
library(vegan)

# Read your abundance data (rows represent samples, columns represent taxa)
abundance_data <- read.table("bracken_abundance.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)

# Calculate Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
bray_curtis <- vegdist(abundance_data, method = "bray")

# Perform a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA)
pcoa <- pcoa(bray_curtis)

# Visualize the results
plot(pcoa)

Visualization
You can create various plots and visualizations to display the differences between samples, such as PCoA plots, heatmaps, or dendrograms.





## Step 4: Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) Analysis for Nanopore Reads

**4.1. Assemble the Metagenome with MetaFlye**

4.1.1. Install MetaFlye:

   ```bash
   # Install MetaFlye (if not already installed)
   conda install -c bioconda metaflye
4.1.2. Run MetaFlye assembly for metagenomics:
# Assemble the metagenome with MetaFlye
metaflye -o metaflye_assembly your_nanopore_data.fastq

Adjust the input file path to match your Nanopore data. The -o flag specifies the output directory for the assembly results.

4.2. Binning with MetaBAT2

4.2.1. Install MetaBAT2 (if not already installed):
conda install -c bioconda metabat2
4.2.2. Perform binning of contigs with MetaBAT2:
metabat2 -i metaflye_assembly/assembly.fasta -o metabat_bins -t 4

4.3. Quality Assessment and Taxonomic Assignment with CheckM

4.3.1. Install CheckM (if not already installed):
conda install -c conda-forge checkm-genome
4.3.2. Assess the quality of the bins and assign taxonomic labels using CheckM:
checkm lineage_wf -x fasta metabat_bins bin_checkm

4.3.3. Review the CheckM report to identify high-quality MAGs based on your criteria.
4.4. Taxonomic Assignment of MAGs

4.4.1. For taxonomic assignment of your MAGs, you can use tools like GTDB-Tk or a similar tool for precise taxonomic classification. Make sure to install the tool and perform the classification:

GTDB-Tk installation and classification:
# Install GTDB-Tk (if not already installed)
conda install -c bioconda gtdbtk

# Classify MAGs using GTDB-Tk
gtdbtk classify_wf --genome_dir metabat_bins/ --out_dir taxonomic_assignment

GTDB-Tk uses a reference database to assign a precise taxonomic classification to your MAGs.

4.5. Functional Annotation

4.5.1. Annotate the genes within your MAGs using an appropriate annotation tool for Nanopore data (e.g., Prokka-Nano or DFAST-Nano):

Prokka-Nano installation and annotation:
# Install Prokka (if not already installed)
conda install -c bioconda prokka

# Annotate the MAGs
prokka --outdir mag_annotation --genus YourGenus bin.fasta

Replace "YourGenus" with the actual genus name identified for the MAG.
